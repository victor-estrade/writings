Here is a short description of a paradox around systematic error.
The first intuition is to train a classifier whose output is more robust to systematic effect ie. some transformation of the input data.

This document will be mostly thoughts on the systematic error *"avec les mains"* without much math.

TDLR
===============================================================================

The total error is the confidence interval, it is computed from data.
The error is a deterministic function of the data.

Assuming the nuisance parameters are fixed (but unknown) :
- If the nuisance parameter have an effect on the data then it can be measured and its effect reduced to (almost) nothing.
- If the nuisance parameter does not have a measurable effect on the data then it does not have influence on the error then there is no systematic error.

Conclusion :
Either systematic error is not a problem or the nuisance parameters are not fixed values but random values with non-zero expectation.

!!! WARNING
    Maybe it is because $E[x] = f(\mu, \alpha)$ not only $E[x] = f(\alpha)$


What is systematic error ?
===============================================================================

This section is about definitions of errors.


What is an error ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When doing inference one must give the most probable value or the average or expected value of the measured parameter.
And an interval which may contain the true value of the measured parameter at 99% chance.

The error is the interval.
A better error is a smaller interval.


What is the total error ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The total error is opposed to the statistical and the systematic error which compose it.

The total error is simply the error of the inference.

It is assumed that :
\begin{equation}
  \text{total error} = \text{statistical error} + \text{systematic error}
\end{equation}



What is the statistical error ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The statistical error is the error comming only from uncontrolled sources.

example :
- limited sample size
- apparatus maximum resolution
- noises

It is impossible to reduce the statistical error with more knowledge.
Only more data samples can reduce it.

It is the **"unknown unknown"**.
Everything that we cannot control which add noise/randomness to the measurements.

!!!
    Yes I am putting the limited sample size inside the "unknown unknown" category.
    Because the sampling process itself by definition should not contain or give any information.
    Samples are taken fully randomly.
    It is not the main subject of this document anyway.

It is opposed to the systematic error which gather the errors from controlled sources.


What is the systematic error ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Systematic error is the error comming from controlled sources.
The "known unknown".

example :
- Temperature of the room
- apparatus imperfection
- etc

Systematic effects are things that will change the measurments and that we cannot avoid or randomize with expectation = zero.
Meaning that the effects will not disapear by taking more data.

Systematic effect are always parametrized.
Parameters of the systematic effect that are not the object of the study are named nuisance parameters.
Parameters of the systematic effect are that are studied are named parameters of interest.

The systematic error is the error coming from nuisance parameters.


example : Studying gravity by making measurements on objects falling from the roof of the building.
Wind, air pressure, magnetic field, coriolis effect do have influence of the measurements but is not the subject of the study.





The paradox
===============================================================================

Computing the statistical error
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compute the statistical error one assums that the value of the nuisance parameters is known and runs the inference.
The total error now only contains the statistical error.


Computing the systematic error
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On way is to compute the total error and the statistical error to get access to the systematic error.

\begin{equation}
  \text{systematic error} = \text{total error} - \text{statistical error}
\end{equation}

But this does not tell us anything about the origin of the systematic error.


Origin of the systematic error
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The origin of the systematic error is the fact that the previously known fixed nuisance parameters are now random variables.

Assuming that $\alpha$ is knwon and $\alpha=1$ when actually we do not know for sure will probably lead to a biased estimation.

To avoid biased estimation the value of $\alpha$ is infered and turned into a random variable.
We traded a reduction of bias for a increase of variance.
But it is obviously better than being confident on a biased value.
