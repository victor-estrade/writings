BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATIONS:
===========================

The objective of the thesis is
[… ]
in the context of
[… ]
This problem is particularly important because
[…]
Although it has been addressed in the past by
[… ]
in restricted and/or related cases such as
[… ]
we tackle novel aspects of it, namely
[… ]
which was not studied before. Furthermore, we cast the problem into a novel framework
[… ]
clarifying the subject with respect to
[… ]
and we propose and compare machine learning methods against established methods, such as
[… ]
We are uniquely positioned to address this problem because
[… ]

MATERIAL AND METHODS:
=====================

To demonstrate advances on this problem, we use
[… ] “real” data (data obtained with a realistic simulator), obtained in the following matter
[…]
We also conduct systematic experiments on a set of smaller didactic examples to clarify the following points
[… ]
We benchmark
[number]
methods. including
[list]
The experiments are carried out on
[impressive computers]
In addition, several theoretical insights are obtained by analyzing successes and failures in numerical expériments. We derived several properties of
[…]
using mathematics of statistics techniques
[… ]

RESULTS:
========

Our results on realistic synthetic data demonstrate that
[… ]
One particular highlight is:
[… ]
This opens the door to:
[… ]
We noticed that, contrarily to results on smaller artificial examples, we have on realistic synthetic the following behavior
[… ]
This prompted us to make a more in depth and detailed study using artificial data, which revealed:
[… ]
This was further substantiated with a theoretical analysis. We proved that
[… ]
analytically. Although such theoretical results are limited by a given set of assumptions
[… ],
they are corroborated by numerical experiments in the broader setting
[… ]
This leads us to conclude with confidence that
[… ]
This is the main result of this thesis.
We also conducted an analysis of the computational efficiency of the algorithms revealing that:
[… ]
All in all method
[… ]
provides the best compromise speed/accuracy.


CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK:
============================

This work allowed us to advance the field of
[… ]
in a number of directions, including
[… ]
[… ]
[… ]
The framework we proposed helped us clarify and unify past work and allowed us to identify critics difficulties not anticipated, such as
[… ]
[… ]
With perseverance, we managed to understand such issues and resolve a number of them using
[… ]
[… ]
But much work remains to be done to improve
[… ]
[… ]
Further research directions include
[… ]
[… ]

NOTES
=====

Ne pas se focaliser sur les stats.
Entre nous on sait la partie ML donc on en parle pas.
Mais ici c'est du ML qui doit ressortir.

Idée du Neural stat -> les exemples individuels ne donne pas d'info.
C'est les ensembles qui contiennent l'info.

C'est pas du transfert...
Reprendre le sujet de thèse (document de départ) et le mettre à jour.
Reprendre le papier de NIPS workshop version longue.
Supervisé vs non-supervisé -> on veut valider la méthode (sur les simulations)

Gap Réalité/Simulation -> transfert learning
Transfert = utiliser les données réelles, sauf qu'on a besoin de valider le modèle...
Mais comment valider un modèle utilisant les données réelle.
Out of scope / trop dur / trop long de changer la méthode de validation du modèle/pipeline.

Reg-Mamouth est à mettre en parallele ou en continuité d'INFERNO.

Manque error stat et error syst dans le discours.
Quid de l'influence de $\gamma << \beta$ sur error stat/syst ?
