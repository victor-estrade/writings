**Validation of the pipeline with ML**


Here I discuss about validation of the inference pipeline.


Validation
===============================================================================

Why validation is important ?

The experiment is extremely expensive making the "repetition" bias even more important.
(j'ai oublié le nom du biais due au fait d'utiliser plusieurs fois le même test set)

The experimental data is supposed to be used only once !
For this reason the experimental data is "locked up in a safe".

The analysis and other inference applied on the experimental data must be carefuly validated.
Validation requires many test on simulations and a deep understanding of its behaviour.


Double seed in Machine learning
===============================================================================

Simulations plays a critical role in validating the pipeline.
Simulations of random behaviour requires to set up a seed.

This seed is also present for real data since real data is at best randomly sampled from real world.
But discussion about sampling biases of real data is not our concern here.

The trained models depends heavily on the training data with is linked to the chosen seed.
Many machine learning methods (random forest, neural networks) also comes with another seed for initialisation and/or sampling order of the training data.

There is 2 seeds then :
1. the simulator one to handle random process
2. the training of machine learning


Not a big deal in ML
===============================================================================

Usually in machine learning this is not a big deal as long as the training data is representative enough to the real distribution.

For example, in binary classification if a region contains slightly less backgrounds than normal the classification boundary may slightly off.
This may only lead to a small group of instances to be misclassified.

**Small difference = small impact on the results**


A big deal in our pipeline
===============================================================================

In our pipeline if a region close to a signal rich bin boundary contains less backgrounds then the boundary may slightly change.

But including even a small amount of unexpected background in a signal rich bin may change a lot the inference of $\mu$

**Small diference = significant impact on the results**
