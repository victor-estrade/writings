**Claim : mining for nuisance parameters improves inference**

This document gather evidence that mining information about the nuisance parameter in the dataset improves inference.
Also note that it seems that some methods (INFERNO and Blind regressor) already exploit this advantage although they are not explicitly design for it.

Core idea
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea originally comes from a naive thought :
> If the systematic effect significantly impacts the data then we can *see* it.
> If we can *see* it then we can measure it.
> If it is measurable, then it can be compensated.
> if we can compensate it then there is no more systematic effect.

Of course this works only if the systematic effect and the studied phenomenom impact can be distinguished.
In real life it is impossible to fully the disentangle the nuisance parameters and parameter of interest impact on data.

But the classic pipeline is optimized a seeting without systematic effect.
The summary statistic ($n_i$) are especially optimized to contain most (if not all) the information about the parameter of interest.
But the information about the nuisance parameters is lost in the process and we have to rely on another measurement : the calibration.

Based on this observation, we propose to also extract information about nuisance parameter from the data.
The likelihood of the generating process is then updated to take this information into account.
The hope is that these new information improves inference ie reduced bias or shorten the confidence interval.
